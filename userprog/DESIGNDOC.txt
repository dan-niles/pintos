			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

No special data structures like the ones mentioned in the question were used for argument passing.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Argument parsing was implemented in the setup_stack function. It was done n the following order.

    Creating two variables named "cont" and "argv" with a default size of 2.

    Use strtok_r to parse the command line, keeping track of each argument in "cont" as it goes. 
	If more space is needed, double the size of both "cont" and "argv".

    After parsing the entire command line, the contents of "cont" will be copied to "argv" in reverse order,
	Each character string will also be pushed onto the stack during the copying process.

    After copying, "argv" will have all the arguments in reverse order, and the stack pointer will be word-aligned (multiple of 4 bytes).

    Push the array of pointers from "argv" onto the stack.

    Push "argv", "argc", and a fake return address onto the stack.

    Free "argv" and "cont".

Contents of cont are copied in reverse order to argv to make sure that they can be pushed onto the stack in the correct order.
The stack pointer was decremented from the size of the item pushed, after anything was pushed to the stack to avoid overflowing.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

Pintos implements strtok_r() as opposed to strtok() due to thread safety issues.
strtok() is not much thread safe. The outcomes of string parsing when many threads use the same instance of strtok() may be unpredictable or inaccurate.
On the other hand, multithreaded systems can safely utilize strtok_r(), which is the reentrant variant of strtok().

An extra argument, a pointer to a variable that records the status of the parsing in between calls, is accepted by the strtok_r() function. 
This makes it possible to utilize many strtok_r() instances simultaneously, each with its own state, without interfering with the others. 


>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

1.Freedom: The Unix approach offers more flexibility than Pintos since users are not forced to adopt a predetermined structure for commands and parameters.
In the Unix approach, users are free to give commands and parameters in any format.
As a result, the user has more control over how to use and execute their commands.

2.Automation: The Unix method enables the user to create shell scripts.
Through the usage of them, a user can automate complicated or repetitive activities by running a series of shell commands.
Pintos does not have this kind of task automation capability.


			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	- In syscall.h :
		> struct lock file_system_lock;
			* Used as a lock for critical section involving modification of files

		> struct child_process {
			int pid;
			int wait;
			int exit;
			int load_status;
			int status;
			struct semaphore exit_sema;
			struct semaphore load_sema;
			struct list_elem elem;
		};
			* This struct holds details (pid, load_status, etc.) about child processes.

		> struct current_file {
			struct file *file;
			int fd;
			struct list_elem elem;
		};
			* This struct holds the file descriptor as well as the content of the file that is currently being worked on.

	- In thread.h : 
		> struct child_process *cp; 
			* Pointer to child process currently running

		> struct file *executable;  
			* Used to deny writes to executables

		> struct list lock_list;    
			* This list keeps track of all the locks the thread holds

		> tid_t parent;          
			* Thread ID of parent process

		> struct list child_list; 
			* List of child processes of the thread

		> struct list file_list;
			* This list keeps track of all the files

		> int fd;                
			* Current file descriptor

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?
  
  File descriptors are unique for each open file for each process. Each process has an independent set of file descriptors. 
  File descriptors are not inherited by child processes. When a single file is opened more than once, 
  whether by a single process or different processes, each "open" system call returns a new file descriptor. 
  Different file descriptors for a single file are closed independently in separate calls to the "close" system call 
  and they do not share a file position.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the kernel.

	When reading and reading, initially we check if the stack pointer is valid. If it is valid, we can 
	dereference it and find the specific system call to run. Using the "fetch_args" function we fetch the arguments that will be 
	used for the "write" or "read" system call. Moving forward we will check the validity of the buffer and if it's ok we can 
	proceed with the system call.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least

>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

	The "wait" system-call calls the proccess_wait function in process.c which loops in a while 
	loop waiting for child processes to terminate, with sentinel being the child process exit member variable. 

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address

>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

	The status of the executable is kept in a child_process struct. Using the process id returned from process_execute, we 
	use a helper function to find the child process of the process executed. From here we can check the status is loaded or not. 
	If it has successfully loaded, the "exec" system call returns the pid. If it has failed to load, the child process is removed and 
	the system call exits returning error code -1.  

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

	* When P calls wait(C), P will stop and wait for C to exit. C exits releasing all of its locks. 
	* If P calls wait after C exits, it will not wait since at this point it has no child processes to wait for since, C has exited.
	* When P terminates before C exits, P will terminate all of its child processses (All locks held by them will be released), so C also gets terminated.
	* Whem P terminates after C exits, C's locks should be released. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

	For user memory access from the kernel, we use function 
	decomposition for error catching. This reduces the difficulty and seems straightforward, simple, and
	efficient rather than implementing page fault memory handling.
  	
	Whenever a pointer is invalid, it will be caught by the page fault interrupt 
	handler. In the interrupt handler the syscall exit(-1) is called.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

	Advantages: 
		* Unique file-descriptor numbers for each process, eliminates the requirement for a global lock on a
		file-descriptor number generator.

		* Unique file descriptor for each process eliminates the requirement to consider for race conditions.

		* Global lock on open file hash table is simple and easy to work with.

	Disadvantages:
		* Per-process file descriptor numbers can make debugging confusing.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

The three problems of this assignment can't be named too easy. But they are not too hard either.
THey were all moderately challenging. It took some amount of time to understand the tasks, decide the methods of implementing the solutions
for the tasks and to debug the errors.


>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Everypart of the assignment typically helped in obtaining a greater insigght of aspects of OS design. 
The argument parsing part showed how arguments are passed to programs and how processes work synchronously and change states.
The system calls part showed how various system calls are being executed by the OS.


>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

The additional document named Pintos Guide was very much useful as it explains how to approach the assignment step by step.
It will be a great help if it can be provided at the begining of the lab 2. 
Also all additional resources provided including the youtube vidieos were very much helpful.


>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

No. The way the TAs helped in the assignment throughout the semester was adequate.


>> Any other comments?

No special comments.
